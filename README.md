# Customer Life Time Value

It is the total value of a customer for that company over their entire relationship with the company.
CLTV is a prediction of the net profit attributed to an ongoing relationship between customer and product. By providing a running estimate on how much a particular consumer is likely to spend on that app, CLTV helps set marketing budgets and ensures that companies pursue the most effective users.

If a company can predict a user’s lifetime value successfully, it provides marketers with a much better base on which to make decisions – helping a company maximize the effectiveness of its advertising spending. The term itself is also known as customer lifetime value (CLV or CLTV) and lifetime customer value (LCV).
